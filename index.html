        <p>Bahía Blanca is a city that is beautiful! It's on the south of Buenos Aires. It has a large population,
            more
            than 500,000. Recently Bahía Blanca didn't have the best luck, we have had many natural disasters, but
            all
            of the people are trying to fight against everything!</p>
